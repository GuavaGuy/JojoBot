        Shigechi
        Speedwagon
        VanillaIce
        Yukako
        Zeppeli

    Of particular note is that all three Pillar Men are grouped together under the "PillarMen" command, and there are not separate commands for each of them. Additionally, differentiate between Josuke from part 4 and Josuke from part 8 with "Josuke4" and "Josuke8" respectively. "Zeppeli" refers specifically to William Zeppeli from part 1, whereas Caesar and Gyro are both referred to by their first names. Finally, for the commands involving multiple words ("HolHorse", "PillarMen", and "VanillaIce"), be sure to capitalize the first letter of each word and do not use a space.

    EXAMPLE:
        "%react Jotaro" will display a random reaction image of Jotaro.
