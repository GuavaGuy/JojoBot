        Annasui
        Araki
        Avdol

        Gappy OR Josuke8
        Jotaro
        Jobin OR Joubin

        Shigechi
        Speedwagon
        Tonio
        VanillaIce
        Yasuho
        Yukako
        Zeppeli

    Of particular note is that all three Pillar Men are grouped together under the "PillarMen" command, and there are not separate commands for each of them. "Zeppeli" refers specifically to William Zeppeli from part 1, whereas Caesar and Gyro are both referred to by their first names. Also, for the commands involving multiple words ("HolHorse", "PillarMen", and "VanillaIce"), be sure to not use a space.
    If you type "%react ___" where "___" is ANYTHING other than what is listed, a "general" Jojo reaction image will be sent. This means it might not related to any particular characters but rather Jojo as a whole, or it might contain many characters rather than be a specific reaction image for one or two.
    Finally, if you want a reaction picture of a specific Stand, use the same command as if you wanted a picture of their user. Stands and their users are not currently separated.

    EXAMPLE:
        "%react Jotaro" will display a random reaction image of Jotaro OR Star Platinum.
