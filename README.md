    Note that you must spell these characters' names as I have here, but these names are NOT case sensitive anymore.
    Acceptable characters:
        Akira
        Annasui
        Araki
        Avdol
        Bruno
        Caesar
        Diavolo
        Diego
        Dio
        Valentine
        Giorno
        Gyro
        Hazamada
        HolHorse
        Iggy
        Johnny
        Jolyne
        Jonathan
        Joseph
        Josuke OR Josuke4
        Gappy OR Josuke8
        Jotaro
        Jobin OR Joubin
        Kakyoin
        Kira
        Koichi
        Mista
        Narancia
        Norisuke
        Okuyasu
        PillarMen
        Polnareff
        Pucci
        Rohan
        Shigechi
        Speedwagon
        VanillaIce
        Yukako
        Zeppeli

    Of particular note is that all three Pillar Men are grouped together under the "PillarMen" command, and there are not separate commands for each of them. Additionally, differentiate between Josuke from part 4 and Josuke from part 8 with "Josuke4" and "Josuke8" respectively. "Zeppeli" refers specifically to William Zeppeli from part 1, whereas Caesar and Gyro are both referred to by their first names. Finally, for the commands involving multiple words ("HolHorse", "PillarMen", and "VanillaIce"), be sure to capitalize the first letter of each word and do not use a space.

    EXAMPLE:
        "%react Jotaro" will display a random reaction image of Jotaro.
